# RPG-Game
A console RPG game project in Python 2.7 ;)
Work in progress:
  - Plot consists of test locations, player professions (skills, leveling, scaling) mobs
  - Game engine is done so game can be already run via double click on Shazam_play.py
  - Plot is to be written, core to be extended to fit plot expectations such as:
    - multiple characters in party combats
    - set of all kinds of mobs and groups of them, basic AI
